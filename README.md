It is now prefered that you use the `poketwo` module in [persona](https://github.com/rodofdiscord/persona). 

## Catchtwo
A second generation **free** and open-source Pok√©two autocatcher, created with the goal of preventing people from wasting their money.

**For a version of this autocatcher that works easily with repl.it, please see the replit branch [here](https://github.com/devraza/catchtwo/tree/replit)**.

### Features
The bot has the following features:
- ‚öôÔ∏è Easy Setup (simply run a script and enter the correct information, no 'coding' needed)
- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Auto-levelling (Level up all your duel Pok√©mon to level 100 **overnight**!)
- ‚ú® Get notified when and if you've caught a Pok√©mon, and also if another event occurs
    - See when a Shiny/Legendary/Ultra Beast/Mythical Pok√©mon is caught, and which one it is!
- üí≤ **Completely free** and open-source (you can see the code as it is currently)
- üíï **Trustworthy**; this autocatcher is **completely** open-source (meaning you can see the latest code)
- üìú Support for all Pok√©mon from generation I to generation VIII, including all Alolan and Galarian Pok√©mon
- üèéÔ∏è Super fast; the autocatcher can even handle Incense!
- üîç Pok√©two-Resistant - the autocatcher sends a random series of numbers to enhance undetectability

### Requirements
Please note that this autocatcher requires Python 3.8 installed. Python 3.9 simply won't work with Discord.

#### <b>Running the bot</b>
To start up the bot for the first time, please download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/devraza/catcher-one/releases/). <br>
Once you have done that, run the `setup.py` file using the command `python3 setup.py` and enter in the following fields when asked:

##### <b>user_token</b>:
Paste in your discord account's user token. You can find instructions on this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W9tAEsK7RM)

##### <b>channel_id</b>:
This will allow the bot to use your preferred channel to spam as well as catch Pok√©two spawns. Make sure you paste this carefully, as If you set it to the wrong channel it will spam and catch there. See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dqYctHmazc) for help on getting this.

After you've entered that in, the autocatcher should start successfully. (if not, check if you have entered in the right fields)

> Remember to cd into your autocatcher folder as well. If you need any help with something, feel free to open a Github Issue.

### Auto-levelling
To enable auto-levelling, just put in the ID's of the Pok√©mon you want to be levelled up into the `level` file (inside the `data` folder).

## **DISCLAIMER**

Please note that self botting is against Discord's Terms of Service and being discovered using a self bot may result in your account being banned. To avoid this, keep knowledge of your self bot to a minimum and use a throwaway account. I am not responsible for any accounts lost due to the self bot. I also recommend checking the self bot channel's messages occasionally to see if Pok√©two has sent a captcha. **If it has, it would be a good idea to solve it.**
