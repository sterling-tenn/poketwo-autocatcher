- 🏎️ Super fast; the autocatcher can even handle Incense!
- 🔍 Pokétwo-Resistant - the autocatcher sends a random series of numbers to enhance undetectability

### Requirements
Please note that this autocatcher requires Python 3.8 installed. Python 3.9 simply won't work with Discord.

### Getting Started:
To start up the bot for the first time, please download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/devraza/catcher-one/releases/). <br>
Then, install the requirements using the following command in your preferred terminal emulator:
```
python -m pip install -U discord.py-self
```
> **If that doesn't work, try this:**
```
pip install -U discord.py-self
```
**If that still doesn't work, please see the below:**

> Remember to modify the command to your installed one if necessary. <br>
> However, this command should work in most cases.

#### <b>Running</b>
Once you have installed the correct dependencies, run the `setup.py` file and enter in the following fields when asked.

##### <b>user_token</b>:
Paste in your discord account's user token. You can find instructions on this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W9tAEsK7RM) <br>

##### <b>channel_id</b>:
This will allow the bot to use your preferred channel to spam as well as catch Pokétwo spawns. <br>
Make sure you paste this carefully, as If you set it to the wrong channel it will spam and catch there. <br>
See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dqYctHmazc) for help on getting this. <br>

After you've done the above, simply run the following command to start up your very own Pokétwo Autocatcher.
```
py main.py
```
The command may vary depending on your operating system, so try `python3 main.py` if this doesn't work.

> Remember to cd into your autocatcher folder as well. If you need any help with something, feel free to open a Github Issue.

### Auto-levelling
To enable auto-levelling, just put in the ID's of the Pokémon you want to be levelled up into the `level.txt` text file.

## **DISCLAIMER**

Please note that self botting is against Discord's Terms of Service and being discovered <br> 
using a self bot may result in your account being banned. To avoid this, keep knowledge of your self bot <br> to a minimum and use a throwaway account. I am not responsible for any accounts lost due to the self bot. <br> I also recommend checking the self bot channel's messages occasionally to see if Pokétwo has sent a captcha. <br> <b>If it has, it would be a good idea to solve it.</b> <br>
